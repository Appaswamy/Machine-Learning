# Machine-Learning
Hi all it is a repository consist of all machine learning algorithms and i am including all the stages of Machine learning algorithms like
- Behind stats of Machine learning Algorithms, 
- Data preparation, 
- Feature selection, 
- Training and testing data split, Fitting and predicting through algorithm, 
- Accuracy of calculation,
- Hyper parameter tuning of algorithms, 
- Comparision of algorithms accuracies of Machine learning algorithms with and with out Hyper para meter tuning, 
- Pros and Cons of that particular Machine learning algorithm, 
- What are the methods available to over come the drawbacks of that algorithm, 
- Exploring Advancement in this domain i.e. in the Machine learning with H2o.ai.
